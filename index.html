            <h3>CSIT Reverse Career Fair</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOaMgLqZ6mc" frameborder="0" title="YouTube video player" width="320" height="240"></iframe>
            <p>Johnson County Community College's CSIT programs hold a "reverse career fair" every semester. 
                A reverse career fair differs from a fake submission traditional career fair in that, instead of employers setting up displays of their organizations at booths for students to approach, 
                the students were at the tables marketing themselves to recruiters. This format makes the students the stars of the show. 
                Students from the programs such as: web, game, computer science, health information systems, networking and cybersecurity, 
                and computer support presented polished résumés and projects to potential employers. 
                In addition to asking about prospective employment opportunities, students inquired about company culture, skills needed for success and more.
